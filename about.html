        <h2>Hi, I'm Bakeung. I'm a Frontend Developer from Kaduna, Nigeria</h2>
        <p>I’m known for my leadership, good nature, and bizarre mix of technical knowledge and interests. 
          From going deep into visual scripting, to goofy augmented reality experimentation, 
          I guess I like to to try new things.
          My current side focus is mentoring young developers to achieve their career goals.
